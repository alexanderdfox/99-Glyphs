99 Glyphs (But a Bit Ain’t One)

(Inspired by hip-hop rhythms with a nerdy twist)

[Verse 1]
I’m coding up a storm, got my IDE bright,
Glyphs lining up like stars in the night.
Variables in order, no bugs in sight,
But that one little bit ain’t acting right.

Got arrays in a flow, loops in control,
Syntax clean, yeah, I’m on a roll.
Regex flex, parsing all the text,
But the bit won’t flip—what’s coming next?

[Chorus]
99 glyphs in my function’s throne,
But a bit ain’t one, nah, leave it alone.
Debugging all day till the code is honed,
99 glyphs, but a bit ain’t one.

[Verse 2]
Stack overflowin’, but I keep my cool,
Binary digits in my digital pool.
Refactor and track, stepping through the stack,
But the rogue little bit keeps pulling me back.

0 or 1, it’s a two-bit world,
Logic gates dance, algorithms swirl.
But this odd glitch don’t obey the law,
Even bitwise ops can’t fix the flaw.

[Chorus]
99 glyphs in my function’s throne,
But a bit ain’t one, nah, leave it alone.
Debugging all day till the code is honed,
99 glyphs, but a bit ain’t one.

[Bridge]
If you’re dealing with a byte, I feel bad for you, son,
I got 99 glyphs, but a bit ain’t one.
Try a NAND, try an XOR, still the same fight,
Tried flipping it back in the dead of night.

Even checked the docs, even Googled deep,
But that bit’s like a ghost that won’t let me sleep.
Binary blues, stuck in the loop,
Calling on the debugger to join the troop.

[Breakdown]
Code compiles, but the test won’t run,
That little bit’s laughing, thinking it’s won.
But I’m persistent, a hacker at heart,
That bit’ll submit when I break it apart.

[Chorus]
99 glyphs in my function’s throne,
But a bit ain’t one, nah, leave it alone.
Debugging all day till the code is honed,
99 glyphs, but a bit ain’t one.

[Outro]
So here’s the truth: coding ain’t all fame,
Sometimes a single bit plays the game.
But I’ll fix that glitch, oh, it’s gonna be done,
’Cause I got 99 glyphs, but a bit ain’t one.
